<h1>Experiences</h1>
<h2>Read the stories of other exchange students who are living in Dublin at the moment!</h2>
<p id="divi"><img id=circle src="pictures/nina12.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:200px"><strong>My school:</strong>: The school is very different from the one I attend in Italy. I love the independance you get from choosing between subjects and find the ones you would like to study the most; being able to decide the level you want to be in is amazing! The school itself is not very big, but does not feel crowded like my school. The lessons are quite short, so I am not exausted after one or two classes. All the classmates made me feel at ease and the teachers have a friendlier approach with the students.

<p><strong>My family:</strong> : My host family is quite small and I am the only exchange student in the house. The whole family is kind to me, nevertheless I still miss my parents. Of course it is not my family, but I know for sure that it could have been worse!</p>

<p><strong>My free time:</strong> : In my free time, I usually hang out with the other exchange students, so I am experiencing bits of cultures other than the irish one. I like museums and art galleries, so whenever I can I go to town and visit as many as I can. I think that Dublin is a beautiful city and even just walking is relaxing. I also love trying new food, so I am always looking for new places to eat. My favourite thing to do is sitting down with a coffee and read a book, that means that sometimes I drag people in bookshops or libraries just to have a look around.</p>

The main purpose of my exchange experience was to learn English, but I also wanted to discover a new country, with another culture and a different scholar system. Surprisingly, in this connected world, we know very little about schools abroad. In Belgium, I had many more subjects, but we have many compulsory classes. That is, according to me, the first good point of my school, Cabinteely Community School. I love science. In my Irish school, I was able to choose to get fifteen classes of science. This more specific education is a better preparation for college and avoids a huge waste of time.The school itself is also very nice, with very welcoming and understanding teachers and cheerful students.

<p><strong>My host family:</strong>
After the school, the host family is generally the biggest concern of exchange students. The name of the concept summarizes it quite well: they are supposed to replace our own family. Before landing here, I did not dare hope to have the same good mood and joyful conversation as at home. They are foreigners to me, and they can be any kind of people. The first relief was the profile of my family: two parents with three children. It sounded like a stable and good environment. The biggest relief was the meeting: they were great!I am very grateful for their concern and efforts and do my best to maintain this good relationship.</p>

<p><strong>My free time:</strong>
As I mentioned previously, one of the aims of this experience is to discover a country and a culture. Therefore, to live these four months to the full, I visit nearly every weekend a new place or go to a new museum. Hence, I spend most of my free time with other exchange students, who are also eager to discover Ireland. The rest of the time we generally do some sport. We study for school as well, even though we have less work than in our respective countries.</p>

<p><img id=circle src="pictures/nino02.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:200px"><strong>My School:</strong>

School here in Ireland is very different from the Italian one but I found it welcoming. Classmates are very sociable and teachers always availed for everything I need, whether it is a question or a concern. The environment is cool and I love how there is a designated classroom for each subject, each with its own schemes and posters, unlike in my country.

<p><strong>My Host Family:</strong>

My host family is experienced and has been doing this job for many years. In my house, there are two more international students, a Korean and a Spanish, and I love talking and confronting with them. The only concern is food, because there are completely different eating habits. Nevertheless, they are always open to my needs and friendly. I feel at home when I am with them.</p>

<p><strong>My free time:</strong>

After school, I usually run in the beautiful park I have next to my house, and on the weekend I go sightseeing with the other international students, in Dublin for example. Weâ€™ve also been to the Wicklow Mountains and we are looking forward to doing a day-trip to Belfast.</p>
